Botted Spring Boot Java Web Application

# about
Botted is an app/bot that determines whether a Reddit user is a bot. Utilizing the Reddit API, machine learning, and our own bot determination methodology we have created a system for indicating whether a user is most likely a bot or a real person by defining how a bot operates. Our app also includes a web interface where a user can submit a post, reddit handle(username), and comment to determine if the user is a bot.
